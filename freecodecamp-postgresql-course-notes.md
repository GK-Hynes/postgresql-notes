## What is a Database?

A database is a place to store, manipulate an retrieve data.

Postgres is the database engine and SQL is the Structured Query Language for interacting with the data.

### How data is stored

In a relational database, data is stored in tables, consisting of columns and rows, and there are relations between these tables.

SQL lets you manage data in a relational database.

### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a modern, open source, object-relational database management system.

### Create a database

`CREATE DATABASE datbase_name;`

### Connecting to a database

From the command line, use `psql -h HOSTNAME -p PORT -U USERNAME DATABASE_NAME`.

Or just `psql \c DATABASE_NAME`.

### Deleting a database

`DROP DATABASE database_name;`

### Creating a table

```SQL
CREATE TABLE table_name (
  column_name data_type constraints
)
```

[PostgreSQL docs for data types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/datatype.html).

You will want to make essential entries, such as id, first_name, `NOT NULL`. Entries that could be empty, such as email, can be left as nullable.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE person (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  gender VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  date_of_birth DATE NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(150)
);
```

### Inserting records into a table

```SQL
INSERT INTO person (
  first_name,
  last_name,
  gender,
  date_of_birth)
VALUES ('Lucy', 'Jones', 'FEMALE, DATE '1990-06-03');
```
