# PostreSQL Notes

Notes on learning PostgreSQL with Jose Portilla's Complete SQL Bootcamp.

## Databases

Databases are systems that allow users to store and organize data.

Spreadsheets:

- Good for one-time analysis
- Work for reasonably sized data sets
- Can be used by untrained people

Databases:

- Data integrity
- Can handle massive amounts of data
- Can quickly combine different data sets
- Steps can be automated
- Can support websites and apps

Compare:

- Tabs = tables
- Columns = columns
- Rows = rows

## PostgreSQL

Free (open source)
Widely used on the internet
Corss-platform

## pgAdmin

pgAdmin is an open source, web-based GUI for managing PostgreSQL.

## SQL Statements

### SELECT

`SELECT` is the most common statement used. It allows you to retrieve information from a table.

`SELECT` can be combined with other statements to perform more complex queries.

```SQL
SELECT column_name FROM table_name
```

You can use `*` to select all the columns from a table.

In general, it's not good practice to use `*` if you don't need all columns. It automatically queues everything, increasing traffic between the dataase server and the application, which can slow down the retrieval of results.

### SELECT DISTINCT

The `DISTINCT` keyword can be used to only return distinct values in a column if the column has duplicate values.

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name
```

You can add parentheses to the column for clarity. They are necessary when adding more calls, such as `COUNT`.

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT(column_name) FROM table_name
```

`DISTINCT` is useful for finding unique values in a column.

### COUNT

The `COUNT` function returns the number of input rows that match a specific condition of a query.

You can apply `COUNT` to a specific column or pass `COUNT(*)`. These should produce the same results sicne each column has the same number of rows.

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name
```

`COUNT` is more useful when combined with other commands, such as `DISTINCT` to get the number of unique values in a column.

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT column_name) FROM table_name
```

### SELECT WHERE

The `WHERE` statement allows you to specify conditions on columns for the rows to be returned.

```SQL
SELECT column_1, column_2 FROM table_name WHERE conditions
```

The `WHERE` clause appears immediately after the `FROM` clause of the `SELECT` statement.

The conditions filter the rows returned from the `SELECT` statment.

The standard comparison operators apply. Not equal to can be represented by `<>` or `!=`

Logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) allow you to combine multiple comparison operators.

### ORDER BY

PostgreSQL sometimes returns the same request query results in a different order.

You can use `ORDER BY` to sort rows based on a column value, in either ascending or descending order.

```SQL
SELECT column_1, column_2 FROM table_name ORDER BY column_1 ASC / DESC
```

`ORDER BY` goes towards the end of the query since you want to do selecting and filtering first before sorting.

`ASC` = ascending order. `DESC` = descending order. If left blank, `ORDER BY` uses `ASC` by default.

You can `ORDER BY` multiple columns in the order you provide them. This helps when the first column has duplicate entries. These can then be ordered by the second column you specify.

```SQL
SELECT column_1, column_2, column_3 FROM table_name ORDER BY column_1, column_3
```

Technically, you can `ORDER BY` columns that you do not explicitly `SELECT`, but it's less readable.

### LIMIT

The `LIMIT` command lets you limit the number of rows returned for a query. It's useful when you don't want to return every row in a table but only view the top few rows to get an idea of the table layout.

It's also useful when combined with `ORDER BY`.

`LIMIT` goes at the end of a query request and is the last command to be executed.

```SQL
SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 1;
```

### BETWEEN

The BETWEEN operator can be used to match a value against a range of values (inclusive of the upper and lower values).

```SQL
value BETWEEN low AND high
```

This is the same as

```SQL
value >= low AND <= high
```

You can also combine `BETWEEN` with the `NOT` operator (exclusive of the upper and lower values).

```SQL
value NOT BETWEEN low AND high
```

Which would be the same as

```SQL
value < low OR value > high
```

The `BETWEEN` operator can also be used with date. You need to format dates in the ISO 8601 standard format: YYYY-MM-DD

```SQL
date BETWEEN '2007-01-01' AND '2007-02-01'
```

When using `BETWEEN` with dates that include timestamp information, pay attention to using `BETWEEN` versus <=, >= comparison operators, since a datetime starts at 0:00.

### IN

In certain cases you want to check for multiple possible value options, for example, if a user's name appears `IN` a list of known names.

Use the `IN` operator to create a condition that checks if a value is included in a list of multiple options.

```SQL
value IN (option_1, option_2, ... option_n)
```

### LIKE and ILIKE

The `LIKE` operator lets you perform pattern matching against string data with the use of wildcard characters:

`%` matches any sequences of characters (including none)

`_` matches any single character

For example, all names that begin with an 'A'

```SQL
WHERE name LIKE 'A%'
```

All names that end with an 'a'

```SQL
WHERE name LIKE '%a'
```

`LIKE` is case-sensitive, `ILIKE` is case-insensitive.

```SQL
WHERE title LIKE 'Mission Impossible _'
```

You can use multiple underscores for multiple characters:

```SQL
WHERE value LIKE 'Version#__'
```

You can combine pattern matching operators.

```SQL
WHERE name LIKE '_her%'
```

PostgreSQL supports [full regex compatibilities](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-matching.html).
