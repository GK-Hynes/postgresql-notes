## Databases

Databases are systems that allow users to store and organize data.

Spreadsheets:

- Good for one-time analysis
- Work for reasonably sized data sets
- Can be used by untrained people

Databases:

- Data integrity
- Can handle massive amounts of data
- Can quickly combine different data sets
- Steps can be automated
- Can support websites and apps

Compare:

- Tabs = tables
- Columns = columns
- Rows = rows
