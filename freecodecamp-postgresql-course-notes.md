## What is a Database?

A database is a place to store, manipulate an retrieve data.

Postgres is the database engine and SQL is the Structured Query Language for interacting with the data.

### How data is stored

In a relational database, data is stored in tables, consisting of columns and rows, and there are relations between these tables.

SQL lets you manage data in a relational database.

### PostgreSQL
